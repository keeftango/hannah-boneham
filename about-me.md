## Inspirational statement about me and what I do

I am a Phd Student in Work Psychology at the [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/management/phd/doctoral-researchers/hannah-boneham), with 12 years’ experience in change management behind me.

I am fascinated by the relationship between leadership and wellbeing (health and happiness) and how we can all empower people to thrive at work.

I really enjoy collaborative work and meeting new people so, please get in touch if you’d like to learn more.
